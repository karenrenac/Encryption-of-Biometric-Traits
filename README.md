![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/242e8264-9c3b-431d-a237-bc20bec7f6f1)

## Overview
This project demonstrates a secure encryption mechanism based on biometric features and AES (Advanced Encryption Standard). The system utilizes biometric feature extraction, quantization techniques, and AES-GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) encryption to securely encrypt and decrypt user data. The biometric key is dynamically derived from the userâ€™s biometric data (e.g., iris or facial features), ensuring robust and personalized security.

## Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to run the project:
1. Clone the Repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/karenrenac/Encryption-of-Biometric-Traits.git
cd Encryption-of-Biometric-Traits-using-AES-Encryption
```
2. Precompute the biometric features by running:
```
python precompute_features.py
```
This script processes the iris and face datasets, extracts features, and saves them in a combined_features.pkl file. The explained_variance.pkl file will be used for data visualization

3. Run the Streamlit App:
```
streamlit run main.py
```
4. Access the App at http://localhost:8501 in your browser.


## Features
1.	Feature Extraction:
*	Utilizes VGG16 (pre-trained CNN) for extracting features from preprocessed iris images.
*	Reduces dimensions of facial attributes using PCA.

2.	Biometric Key Generation:
*	Quantizes combined biometric features into binary keys.
*	Converts the binary key to AES-compatible byte format.

3.	AES-GCM Encryption and Decryption:
*	Encrypts user-provided text data or file using a biometric-derived AES key.
*	Ensures data integrity using authentication tags.

4.	Streamlit Web Interface:
*	User-friendly frontend for encryption and decryption.
*	Options to upload biometric features or dynamically generate synthetic ones.
